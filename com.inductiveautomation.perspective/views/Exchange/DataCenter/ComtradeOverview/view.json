Comtrade files can be imported in a few different ways, including FTP, SFTP, and local drag/drop.\nOnce a file is imported, it can be selected to then view. Any channels in the selected file will show as options to toggle for display. Toggled channels will show in the top chart, which is a range selector tool.\nA particular subset of data can be selected in the range selector to then view in more detail at a higher resolution in the bottom chart. The bottom chart provides the ability to view the selected data at a sub-millisecond resolution and provides x-trace capability.\nData can also be exported to view in 3rd party applications for further analysis.\u003c/p\u003e",
